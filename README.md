# Maze-Generator
 
The following project is capable of generating unique mazes of varying difficulties. 
The user can attempt to solve the mazes on the screen using arrow keys. The program is also capable of saving these mazes as csv files so that the mazes can be attempted later or by a different user. 

The user interface provides a game-like experience where different users
can create separate accounts and attempt the same mazes.
 
Users can view their time taken to solve the maze and their best time at a maze of that difficulty.

## Maze Algorithm

In order to draw the maze, we have used several pygame features. The maze consists of a grid of coordinates - a 2D list in our program. After drawing the borders and openings of the maze, the remaining coordinates are filled using randomly generated snake lines.


#Snake lines:
The program creates a list of directions which represent a line that would look natural in a maze and will not form closed loops or spirals. These randomly generated lines usually resemble snakes, hence we are calling them snake lines. A random coordinate in the maze is chosen as the start point of the snake line. The general direction of the line is chosen. A snake line moving in that direction is created. The snake line is drawn until it reaches a coordinate which is already filled.

This ensures thatthe mazes generated by this algorithm will always have a proper solution and there will only be one solution for each maze.
